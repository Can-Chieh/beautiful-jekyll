>[Favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) (short for favorite icon), also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon. 

#### Just put a favicon.ico file to the root.
Then it will be copied to the _site directory on generation!

#### How to generate the favicon.ico.  
There is a online website [realfavicongenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).  

That's all. It is easy right.
